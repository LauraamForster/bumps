To use the compiled de stepper and bounds checks use:

    (cd bumps/dream && cc compiled.c -I ../../Random123/include/ -O2 -shared -lm -o _compiled.so -fPIC)

This only works when _compiled.so is in the bumps/dream directory.  If running
from a pip installed version, you will need to compile this by hand separately
and copy it into the distribution tree.  There is no provision for using this
in a frozen application.
